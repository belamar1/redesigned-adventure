The Golden Square Challenges
Coaching this? Read the coach guidance here.

In this module your objectives are:

Learn to test-drive programs with multiple classes.
Learn to break programs up into classes.
Learn to debug your programs.
Learn to build software as a pair.
Learn to explain why test-driving, object-oriented design, debugging, and pairing are powerful practices for software engineers.
You will achieve these by working through a sequence of exercises and challenges over two weeks.

Sequence
Work through each of these exercises in sequence.

Phase Zero: The Golden Square Practices
This is reference material. Review each of these so that you can refer back to them as you work through the challenges.
